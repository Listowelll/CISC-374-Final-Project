## **Blurb**

Big‑O Heist is an exciting, fast‑paced educational adventure that transforms algorithm analysis into a high‑stakes treasure hunt. Players must quickly determine the Big‑O time complexity of code snippets while a digital bomb ticks down and a hacker avatar reacts in real time. Correct answers open chests and advance you through three unique island scenes filled with puzzles, while wrong choices trigger immersive feedback teaching you the right solution. Perfect for students and coding enthusiasts, Big‑O Heist makes mastering algorithmic thinking both challenging and fun.
